      <p> Hi I'm performing here at this time! </p>
      <p> Hi I'm the comedy page! Any comedy Jay has written will be here</p>
      <a> I'm a link to my youtube channel</a>
      <a> I'm a link to my twitter</a> <br/> <br/> 
      <p> somehow I will be able to host my comedy videos on a Bluzelle DB and allow you to stream it through React </p>
      <p> somehow these streams will also somehow turn the users' computer into a blockchain node in order to validate other nodes in the network</p>
      <p> this will create a currency for the user and a specific layer will trade JayCoin and UserCoin back-and-forth repeatedly in order to raise the value of each individual's currency</p>
