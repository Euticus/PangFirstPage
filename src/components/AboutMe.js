      <p> Hi there,  <br/> <br/>
      This is the website of both, Ryan Miller and Jay Stewart. <br/><br/>
      I wrote this website to showcase some new ideas I've been working on to implement Blockchain solutions. 
      I'm from the East Coast but have a West Coast heart. I went to Flatiron School in 2019 and that really
      turned me on to the fascinating world of programming. <br/> <br/> 
      You can use this site to access any content I put up. All you have to do is sign-in. I have comedy, a blog, and some music I made.
