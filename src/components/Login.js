    <div> 
      <h2>I'm the login page!</h2>
      <textarea> login here...</textarea><br/>
      <textarea> password here... </textarea>
      <button> login</button>
      <p>Don't have an account? </p> <a>sign up</a>
      <hr/><hr/> 
      <p> Ok so this login does     a lot... it
        <li>creates a blockchain node on the user's machine, holding their own personal information. (the genesis block) </li> 
        <li>creates a currency for the user </li>
        <li>creates a bot to trade with JAYcoin when the user streams or acesses my content </li>
        <li>this would also have to create a wallet for the user</li>
      </p>  <hr/>
      <p>Damn this is a shit ton of work and I don't know the first thing about creating an automated blockchain process..
         hmmm... just gotta think what I'm gonna be doing.
