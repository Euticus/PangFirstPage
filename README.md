---TO BEGIN---

  npm start

---NOTES---
  1. nothing really going on. Simple create-react-app   --10/21/2020 @ 2:56pm
  2. ok got the bones of what I want to be the frontend. I'd like to start writ ing the API to make calls to the Bluzelle DB
     oh I guess I could write a better login/signup page. Kind of important. 
     it wouldn't be terrible to have the frontend partially handle the admin/user conditionals. it wouldn't really make sense to have the entire backend dhandle that. If it handed the user a randomly generated key for that session, that would make it very secure actually.
     It is looking like the next step is writing this API... I can't get this to compile at all and I don't have the internet to look up the shit I need to.     --


---TODO---
  1. API
      a. Golang
  2. BluZelle DB
  3. blockchain layer ( how. just. how. ) 
      a. Golang
      b. I guess the network could run on a small azure cloud server to start??? Maybe? 
  4. automation layer 
      a. written in python
      b. creates:
          i. wallet
          ii. blockchain node
          iii. genesis block for user
          iv. currency for user 
          v. ability to perform automated trades between my currency and user's currency 

****Damn this is a shitton of work to do without any knowledge of how to write a blockchain
****like how do you deploy a blockchain?? creating a network that runs on a single computer to start
****Ugh I'm too all over the place.. I gotta concentrate on just creating the API that interfaces with BluZelle DB
